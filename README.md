### Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a package with logic for file reading, data preprocessing and developing machine leaning models. There are two files used as input h1n1_vaccine_prediction.csv and Life Expectancy Data.csv. The goal is to validate package creation and function calling from the main program.

### Key Steps
1. Package creation for Reading File
2. Package creation for Data Preprocessing
3. Package creation for Model Training
4. Package creation for Model Evaluation

### Requirements
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

### How to Run
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Load the dataset and run the main script
